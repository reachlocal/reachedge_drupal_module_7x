Module: ReachEdge
Author: ReachLocal <https://www.drupal.org/user/3405578>

Synopsis
========
The ReachEdge Drupal module adds the tracking software on all
the pages of your website. ReachEdge software tracks phone calls,
visits, sessions and leads, captures email and form submissions.

ReachEdge gives access to an online dashboard and mobile application
that provide you visibility into your inbound leads and tools to follow
up with these leads.

Requirements
============
ReachEdge Site ID

ReachEdge Site ID is only available for those clients who are subscribed
to ReachEdge.

To find your ReachEdge Site ID refer to the following steps:

Sign into ReachEdge.
Navigate to Settings tab, and click on 'Tracking Code'.
From Option 2, copy the Tracking ID. It should look something
like: d4098273-6c87-4672-9f5e-94bcabf5597a
Note: Do not use the example tracking code id as it will not work properly.
If you have difficulty with this step or cannot find your Tracking ID,
please contact your ReachLocal account representative.

Roadmap
=========
The javascript is loaded from a CDN and is under continuous development to
provide the best performance and stability across all browser and OS

Option to cache the javascript loaded from the cdn daily
An interface into reporting
